This project is a complete, production-style machine learning system that takes you all the way from raw data to a live, interactive web application. It’s designed to show how a real-world ML pipeline should be built — clean, modular, reproducible— while still being easy to understand and extend.

It focuses on good engineering practices like separating preprocessing from modeling, preventing data leakage, and making the system usable through a simple web interface for real-time predictions.
